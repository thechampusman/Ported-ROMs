# Ported ROMs

## Overview

**Ported ROMs** is a cross-platform mobile application built with **Flutter & Dart** that provides a centralized platform for users to search, browse, and download various custom and ported ROMs for Android devices.

This project was developed out of personal passion for Android ROM porting and aims to make it easier for users to find compatible ROMs for their specific devices.
